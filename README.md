# Miguel Dias — Portfolio (Static)

This repository hosts a ready-to-serve static single-page portfolio for Miguel Dias.

Deployed at: https://migueljdias.github.io/

What I pushed:
- index.html — static site using Tailwind CDN and Google Fonts (Inter). Links: LinkedIn and Email are already set.

Notes:
- No resume file was added as requested.
- To update content, edit index.html and push changes to the main branch.

Local testing:
- You can preview locally by opening index.html in a browser or serving with a static server (e.g., `npx http-server`).
